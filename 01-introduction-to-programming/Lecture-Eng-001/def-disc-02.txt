Understanding Computer Programming: The Language that Bridges Human and Computer Communication


Since a computer is a completely digital device and since digital devices rely on logic gates, a computer can only understand binary (0 and 1) or True/False. These binary instructions are called machine code.

Therefore, if we want to make a computer perform a task, we must give instructions in a language that the computer understands. Since this language is entirely based on mathematical and logical principles, and the instructions are arranged step by step, this set of arranged instructions is called "programming".

And since programming is the means through which communication with the computer takes place, it is called "programming language".

Thus, we can say that programming is a set of mathematical and logical instructions, which, when given as input, are understood by the computer and produce the corresponding output.

Summary of Key Points:
✅ A computer understands only 0 and 1 → This is called machine code.
✅ We must give instructions in a language that the computer can understand.
✅ These instructions are a set arranged mathematically and logically, known as programming.
✅ Programming language is the medium through which communication with the computer happens.
